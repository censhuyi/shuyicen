			<h4>The Overview</h4>
			<p>
				Forte’s Fresh Burgers, formerly known as Five Dollar Fresh Burger Stop, is a food truck located on Market and 33rd, serving burgers and fries to college students and local workers. Our team was familiar with the food truck’s delectable offerings and personable staff so we decided to develop a practical mobile take-out app that reflected their culture. Founder and owner, Damon Forte, was excited to shared his plans to expand the food truck and rebrand to what is being developed as Forte’s Fresh Burgers. We had to take this change into account when designing the interface for the app. In order to design the best product that people would want to use, we also had to think about who our users are and how they would use the app.

			<h4>
				The Challenge
			</h4>
			<p>
				Due to the pandemic, the food supply chain has significantly slowed down and resulted in much higher prices with inflation. This has impacted Forte’s Fresh Burgers ability to provide burgers (with fries and a drink) at the price of their former name. Damon Forte, the owner and founder of the food truck, recognized and addressed this by evolving his business with the market. Damon plans to rebrand to focus on the fresh ingredients and recipe he uses. We were challenged to assist in the rebranding efforts which are reflected in the design phase of building our digital product. <br/> With some direction, we had to develop a new brand style for the food truck app. 
Another challenge we faced was the constraint of working with a small menu. This menu was small because it was dependent on the customer’s preferences when customizing the burger. In our fly on the wall observations, we documented earlier in the user flow that each customer had to approach the kiosk ordering system. This system allows for adding different toppings and taking out others when ordering. In developing the interface, we wanted to stay true to the ability of developing a unique burger to the customer. 
			</p>
			<h4>The Business</h4>
			<p>
				Our team took several steps to better understand Forte's business model and structure. They included having an on-site interview with Damon, gathering observations, and conducting secondary research on the internet from their website, social media accounts, and Yelp. The interview with Damon informed our understanding of the brand’s culture, the target audience, and vision for the food truck. One hope that Damon expressed in his vision was to expand to other university campuses and open a storefront. In our prototype task flow, we considered how the app could be potentially used with different trucks that might have different menu. This is reflected by the location selection at the beginning of the ordering process. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The observation study informed customer behavior and interaction points. Customers began their order at the digital kiosk, which by design, allowed for quick and convenient ordering. A majority of the time was spent after waiting for the food. The longer food took the more restless customers tended to be. In consideration, we made pick-up times for orders adjustable to fit the schedule and need of customers that does not want to wait. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The secondary research informed how customers view the food truck. This confirmed a lot of previous knowledge we had gained from other research. The top takeaway was that the workers treat customers like friends which keep them coming back for the service and affordable prices. While this might be true for a lot of trucks, what makes Forte’s burger stand out is their burger menu and considerations to improving the customer experience through the kiosk, both of which no other local food truck has. 
			</p>
			<h4>
				The Target Audience
			</h4>
			<p>
				Through fly on the wall observations and an interview with Damon we determined the target audience to be primarily college students, local residents, and working professionals including local workers and Drexel faculty. In our interview, Damon says that he wants to cater specifically towards hungry college students, hence its location. During our fly on the wall observations, our team collected data by staking out during busy hours where it was documented of how many people order food at the food truck, their ages, and occupations. One challenge we met with was gathering this information with a variety of observation times. All of our research was done with at least an hour by each of our team members and trying to collect the most accurate information for the design. Once we collected information on our audience, we formed three user personas to base our design decisions around: the spender, the go getter, and the explorer. We used the main character traits from these personas to determine that we needed an app that was simple to use on the go, provided important information about the truck's times and location, and let both new and returning users order food quickly. With these goals in mind, we proceeded to develop our design process.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Process
			</h4>
			<p>
				To begin our process, we had to consider what kind of mood and aesthetics we were going for with this app. We were in the unique position of having a business in the midst of a rebrand, so we had full creativity over colors to choose and general theming. We each created moodboards to convey the sort of vibe we thought we could bring to the apps creation. ​​
